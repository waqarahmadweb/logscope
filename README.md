# Logscope

> **Status:** `v0.8.0` — Settings UI + custom log path. The Settings tab now ships a real editor for `log_path` and `tail_interval`, with a side-effect-free "Test path" probe that runs `PathGuard` server-side and renders the verdict (resolved absolute path, allowed roots, rejection reason) inline. Polish, accessibility, and i18n land in Phase 11 before the v1.0.0-rc.1 cut.

A free, GPL v2 WordPress plugin that streams, filters, and groups the WordPress debug log from inside wp-admin.

## Highlights (planned)

-   Virtualized viewer for `debug.log` — handles 10k+ lines.
-   Tail mode, severity / regex / date-range filters.
-   Error grouping by signature (file:line + message shape).
-   Stack trace parsing with copy-to-clipboard.
-   Email + generic-webhook alerts for new fatals, rate-limited.
-   REST-first architecture (`/wp-json/logscope/v1/*`), React admin UI.
-   **Free forever.** No paid tier, no telemetry, no upsells.

## For contributors & AI agents

-   [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) — phased, versioned plan from scaffold → v1.0.0 (wp.org) → v1.1+ updates.
-   [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) — versioned history.
-   [docs/spec.md](docs/spec.md) — long-form technical specification.
